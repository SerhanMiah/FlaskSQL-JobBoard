  ## Final Project 

For my final project, I built a full-stack web application using a combination of Flask, Python, CLI, AJAX, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Bootstrap, Insomnia, and SQLite3. The project consists of a backend API built with Flask that connects to a frontend web application built with React and Bootstrap. The API is powered by a SQLite3 database and supports CRUD operations for managing resources.

One of the main features of the project is its CLI interface, which allows users to interact with the backend API using a command-line interface. The CLI is built with Python and supports a variety of commands for querying, creating, updating, and deleting resources.

The frontend web application is built with React and uses AJAX to communicate with the backend API asynchronously. The user interface is designed using Bootstrap and Jinja templates and provides a seamless experience for browsing and managing resources.

To test the API and debug any issues, I used Insomnia, a powerful REST API client that allows me to send HTTP requests and inspect responses in real-time. Overall, this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of full-stack web development and gave me hands-on experience with a wide range of technologies and tools.
